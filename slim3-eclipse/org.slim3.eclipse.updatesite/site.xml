      Slim3 is a full-stack MVC framework optimized for Google App Engine/Java, and you can use Slim3 as just a datastore framework, too.


Our main concept is &quot;Simple&quot; and &quot;Less Is More&quot;. &quot;Less is more&quot; means simplicity and clarity lead to good design. 

80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes. This is known as The Pareto Principle. We concentrate all our energies into 20% of the causes. Programmers can resolve the other issues without framework constraints. 

We want to get rid of complex and bloated features from your applications and our framework. As a result, we will slim down.
